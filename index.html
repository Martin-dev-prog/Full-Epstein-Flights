    üîí 205-07-26 ‚Äì LETTER FROM NI POLICE FOIR
  </h3>

  <p style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.3em; text-transform: uppercase; margin-bottom: 0;">
    I HAVE RECEIVED A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION RESPONSE FROM PSNI DATED 26TH JULY 2026 CONFIRMING MY DAUGHTER WAS NEVER IN NORTHERN IRELAND ‚Äî DESPITE A UK COURT ORDER CLAIMING SHE WAS. THIS CONFIRMS THAT THE ORDER WAS UNENFORCEABLE AND MISLEADING. THEIR FAILURE TO ACT ON INFORMATION OF CRIMINAL INTENT SUGGESTS THE ONLY REASON THEY COULD NOT ACT IS BECAUSE SHE WAS NEVER THERE.
